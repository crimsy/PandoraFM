20071013 PandoraFM v3

Keep in mind this has never been tested against any other environment.  And most things may need tweaking.


To Configure:
Run PandoraFMSchema.sql against a database somewhere.
Edit inc/db.inc and edit the dbserver, dbuser, dbpass, dbname values to point to your MySQL database.
Edit inc/template.txt and utils/inc to change the hostname & email address you want in the recommendation emails.
Edit inc/errors.inc to point to your local errorlog.txt file.
Edit inc/log.inc to point to your local log.txt file.
Edit flickrsearch.php's url string to put in a different API key.

Do a massive find/replace to replace pandorafm.real-ity.com with your host.
