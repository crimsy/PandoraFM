The PandoraFM Player interface was built to be similar to Pandora's.  I hope it's easy to use and quite functional as an alternative to the official install of the Last.FM client.

Click the "external player" icon in the upper right to play Last.FM radio in any mp3 player of your choice.  iTunes, WinAmp, Windows Media Player or any other player that takes playlists.  This includes any device that plays a mp3 stream like a tivo, squeeze box or mobile platforms.   Give it a shot on your Palm or PocketPC device!

Click on the artist name to bring up information about that artist.

Some ideas:
	* Make Last.FM stations by tagging songs in Pandora as the name of the station it's playing you.  You can then play that same station any time in Last.FM's tag radio.  Use the quick tag button or autotag for best use of this.
	* Listen to your recommendation radio and when you hear an artist you really like click "Hear more like this on Pandora".  It will use the music genmoe to find music similar instead of using social matching in Last.FM to find music that others who liked the first artist would like.
